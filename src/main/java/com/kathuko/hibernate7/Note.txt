Hibernate 7

LAZY(Default) and EAGER fetch
-- Lazy fetch is if session is closed, we cannot get data
	* Query1 -- Only first level member variable will be initialized in get()
	* Query2 -- Second level will be fetched on getter methods
	* Once session is closed, cannot fetch data

-- EAGER fetch is even if session is closed, we can fetch data.
	* Query 1 & 2 -- Both level member variable will be initialized in get()
	* Object fetch - Second level will be fetched on getter methods 
    * Even after the session is closed, the data will be fetched from object

_________	
While session.get() -> does it fetch only the current Entity data or also the collection data?
 -- It fetches only the Entity data
 	user = session.get(User,id)
 -- If you want collection data we use getter method of collection, so  another query will be triggered
    user.getListOfAddress() uses proxy class

    
    
2 things to be note
-> Way of data fetch
  * Lazy -> 
    ~ For first level entity data, one query will be fired
    ~ For each and every other level collection data, one query will be fired
  *
