Hibernate2

Includes
@Embeddable annotation at class level
@Embedded annotation at object level of parent class



+ Hibernate 3

When two Embedded object is introduced, there will be ambiguity in column name
It needs to be resolved

Address
 - Street
 - city
 - State
 - pincode
 
@Embedded
Address home_Address
@Embedded
Address office_Address

  both home and office objects have same fields (Street, City, State, Pincode) in DB
we can't have duplicate column name

So we are introducing 

@AttributeOverrides
